Conclusion: Never let your Firebase project alone!

Fun Fact: <img src="https://d3e0luujhwn38u.cloudfront.net/resized/qIQXsE93cF-dR0O6oSkXDG7eX_k-OATJYUGWF4LL9NI/s:1200/plain/s3://typefully-user-uploads/img/original/10070/b071861a-8c31-4a6e-9cd2-9921bde538e8.png__edited" alt="Firebase Storage" >

From the original post:

> I had cloudflare in front of my stuff. Hacker found an uncached object and hit it 100M+ times. I stopped that and then they found my origin bucket and hit that directly.

> CF Workers can access private bucket storage to keep that more secure but workers are billed per instance/minute.

> I think I needed rate limiting too which doesn’t seem to be default.

> I can’t risk making a minor config mistake and having it cost me 100k.

> Done with cloud.
