description: I subscribe to Vercel Pro for $20 per month. I also added a spending limit of $120, so no nasty surprises, right?

Conclusion: It was a mistake on Vercel's side. They will not charge him for this.

tldr: The user set a spending limit of $120, but Vercel charged him $738.420 and his application was offline for 2+ hours, due to hard spend limit. The notification of the huge payment was a mistake by Vercel.
