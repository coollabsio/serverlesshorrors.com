[What happened](https://x.com/CuratedDesignHQ/status/1922364527644979481)

Conclusion: They auto-migrate you to a higher plan (enterprise) if your bandwidth (lots of images cached) is too high. Only one vague warning email was sent.

+ They won't let you offload images to another service (like Cloudflare or BunnyCDN), because they lock-in an SSL toggle, that is required to move images.
